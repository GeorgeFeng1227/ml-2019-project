## Classifying aggression in Wikipedia comments

Using 100k comments gathered by the Wikipedia Detox project, we aim to create a program that can read in comments and generate a rating for how aggressive they are.

![_Dataset_](https://github.com/pguntunur/ml-2019-project/blob/master/photos/pic-dataset.png)

First, we run the comment data through various preprocessing steps, filtering out punctuation and stop words and using the data to create an array. Using the aggression ratings given by Wikipedia Detox, we then create a target vector of whether a comment is aggressive or not. After, we generate a vector using TfidfVectorizer that represents the words contained in each comment. From the data and target vectors, we finally use a LinearSVC model to fit the data with an accuracy of 91.4%.
